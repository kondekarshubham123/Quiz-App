# Quiz-App

Welcome to the Quiz-App repository! This application is designed to manage questions and answers for a quiz-based system. Whether you're interested in exploring the Monolithic or Microservices architecture, you've come to the right place. Feel free to choose the architecture that aligns with your preferences.

## Architecture Branches

### Monolithic Architecture

The Monolithic architecture is designed for simplicity and ease of deployment. All components of the application are tightly integrated into a single unit.

To learn more about the Monolithic architecture and explore its code, check out the [Monolithic Branch](https://github.com/kondekarshubham123/Quiz-App/tree/architecture/monolithic).

### Microservices Architecture

The Microservices architecture promotes modularity and scalability by breaking down the application into smaller, independent services.

If you're interested in exploring the Microservices architecture and its implementation, you can find it in the [Microservices Branch](https://github.com/kondekarshubham123/Quiz-App/tree/architecture/microservices).

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `architecture/monolithic`: Code and resources for the Monolithic architecture.
- `architecture/microservices`: Code and resources for the Microservices architecture.

Feel free to navigate through the respective branches to find detailed information about each architecture.

## Getting Started

To get started with either architecture, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the chosen architecture branch (`monolithic` or `microservices`).
3. Follow the instructions provided in the respective branch's README to set up and run the application.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have any suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
